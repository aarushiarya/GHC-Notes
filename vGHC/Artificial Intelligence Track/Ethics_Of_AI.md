Haerin Shin, Assistant Professor of English, Vanderbilt University

Recent advancements in research and application have established machine learning as not only a pervasive base structure but also a superstructual force that reflects and shapes the public conscious. Seemingly impartial due to its machinic nature yet constitutionally reliant upon existent identificatory parameters such as gender, race, nationality, religion, class, and age, algorithmic reasoning is in fact heavily steeped in human bias, drawing its source from culturally coded data. This featured session will explore the background and impact of bias in AI.
