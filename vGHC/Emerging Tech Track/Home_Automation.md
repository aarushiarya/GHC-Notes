# Home Automation and Inclusive Design
Kate Freebairn, UX Director, Google; Rachel Been, Design Lead, Google

Automation and inclusive design has empowered historically underserved populations via technology, but also opened the door for abuse. We are in a new era of automation with the introduction of ambient computing in the home - and although the opportunities for inclusive design and home automation are that much greater, we have a responsibility to consider the externalities of our work.

### Notes

* Google Nest - create thoughtful home that takes care of people who leave in it
* Inclusion dimension - vision, hearing, touch, speech, gender, age, culture and language, socio-economics
* Why do we need to innovate inside house?
    * In 1890, no running water/ central heating
    * 58 hrs a week spend on household work
    * Carry 7 tons of coal; 9000 gallons of water
* Success depended on affordability and efficiency of machinery
* Technology liberated women from household work
    * 1920 - the 19th ammendment
    * 1940 - 1944 - WWII

    * Reduce cognitive labor
        * Reduce multi-tasking, comprehension, cognitive load required to run a modern household 
        * Ambient computing 
            * system that knows, understand you; can do things on your behalf, help in different ways

                * Seasonal savings - help you save money by re-setting temp, etc
    * Women have high cognitive burden to do it all
    * To achieve this, we need to train machines to understand human

            * Explanation about why automation was recommended
            * Clear visibility of what data is recorded and where is it used
        * Equality
            * Testing cycles with diverse people
    * Way we communicate with tech
        * Touch 
        * Voice
