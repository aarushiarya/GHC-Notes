### Notes

* Blockchain basics
    * Record of all tractions
    * Data store - contain result of processing each blockchain transaction
    * Smart contract - business logic
* Blockchain benefits - immutable, secure, distributed, transparent

        * Doctors -usage record
        * Distributor center - shipping record
        * Patient - would like to know if vaccine followed regulations, good quality, met FDA compliance, stored in right conditions
        * End to end process of supply chain monitored using smart contracts

    * Supplier qualification and validation
        * Masks - what kind of face mask you need? Do you trust face mask supplier?
        * Blockchain based solution can give trustful solution
