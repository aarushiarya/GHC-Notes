# Finding the Human Behind Tech: Building Products for Emerging Markets
Ginger Baker, Head of Open Finance, Plaid

Tech is transforming emerging markets—but for too long, it has been in a bubble, forgetting to problem-solve for those who need it most. On a quest to better understand hard-to-reach consumers, Ginger has sought to bridge the gap between products and people. She will share stories of her time building products for "forgotten" customers and how tech is connecting them to the rest of the world.

### Notes
* When building products - we look at charts or data to make important decisions
* These important decisions - drive what the UI would look like, how the customer will interact with the product
* But what is even more important than this - human element
* What is the behavior of customer? What is user’s day-to-day activities? How does the customer interact today?
* Users habits, aspirations, feeling
* Challenging to understand just from the data
* Product - mVisa - visa mobile only ecosystem worked on all phones
* Aim - To make Rwanda cashless
* User - Digitally aware, unsatisfied with current financial system
* Followed user to get money - go to town to get money - as the place had Air Conditioner - even though took longer time and more fees
* Next project - Facebook banking access
  * Philippines liked and used Facebook
  * Not using financial apps
* Collaborated with local apps and connected with messenger bot
* Clear value proposition - access / speed / convenience / cost
* Results - account creation - went viral 
  * Purchase data packs for prepaid phone plans
  * Share with friends
  * Engage service provider
  * But not as much attraction with paying monthly bills - underperformed across all matrix
* Guiding Principle
  * Consider
    * Convenience is not as important as control
    * People let others handle the details like account number, difficult to setup
    * Transaction was too big and too risky
  * Listen Deeply
    * Obvious gap and inconvenience around travel / time spend
    * Listen deeply about exact issues of users
  * Be opportunistic
    * Able to test and get feedback
