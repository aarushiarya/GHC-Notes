Manage your Unknown Unknowns: How to Lead with Outcomes to Manage Uncertainty in Product

Pallavi Shingte, Product Manager, Factset

Are features at the center of your product planning process? Then you are setting up your product team to fail. Building products is inherently complex and filled with uncertainty. Outcome-based planning can help manage that uncertainty. Learn the difference between outputs and outcomes, how to transition from focusing on outputs to focusing on outcomes and better manage uncertainty in product.

* Surrounded by products - with useless features
* Work like feature factory
* Lose focus on what delivers true value to customers
* Shift focus from outputs to outcomes
* Goal - update legacy reporting product - internal tool - financial team used to build reports for customers
* Financial team couldn’t keep up with request for support
* Sales team given access to help
* Followed agile
* Product was not used - financial team never shifted because new features were not worth it
* Sales team couldn’t learn how to use the product
* Old report were not able to be migrated to new product
* New features - gave sense of progress
* No value delivered to business or customers
* How should we measure progress?
  * Features - not indicate value
  * Business impact - indicate value but lagging indicator, takes months or years to see the impact; outside span of control
  * Look for change in behavior - if you deliver new product, should change the users behavior, to create value
* Measure progress by change in behavior of users
* How to actually do that?
  * How many professional team member switched?
  * How many sales member are using?
  * Is customer requests getting answered faster?
* Shift your focus 
* Feature -> change in behavior - Map business impact
  * Impact mapping
  * What is the high level impact we are trying to achieve? 
    * Entering new market, reduce cost, increase revenue
  * Who are the actors whose behavior we can change? 
    * That help us achieve business impact
  * What behaviors can we encourage to create the impact we want?
  * How can we change these behaviors through our product?
* Example grocery delivery service like instacart
  * Impact - increase reverence
  * Actors - busy professionals , shoppers, suppliers
  * Outcome - shop more frequently, buy more products per order
  * Output - new item notification, discount coupons, receipt ideas newsletter
* Feature -> hypothesis - frame feature hypothesis
* Example - new item hypothesis
  * We believe that building this feature for these people will result in this outcome
  * We believe that providing new item notifications for busy professionals will result in them shopping more frequently.
  * We will know this is true when we see 10% users placing order twice a week.
* Ship -> experiment - test your hypothesis
* Experiment to learn (not earn)
  * Myriad of user research methods
  * uncover new information
  * Iterate
* What to test?
  * Low uncertainty - don’t test
  * High value - high certainty
* Example - monitor people are able to check out and traffic is not dropping at checkout
* Experiments should be fast and cheap
  * Build 20% functionality that gives 80% value
  * Doesn’t need to scale or be robust
* Single -> collective - empower your team
  * Include the entire team in product discovery
    * Collective wisdom
  * Set team ok’s using outcomes as key results
    * Spark innovation
    * You give team what outcome you want to achieve
    * Team has the freedom to innovate and reach outcome
* Unknown -> known
* Take one small step
* Think about changes in behaviors you expect to see from feature you already shipped
* Re-frame on feature on your roadmap as a hypothesis
* Create a simple survey to test one assumption
* Invite your designer and lead engineer to your next discovery meeting
* Write down one new insight you learned by taking this small step
