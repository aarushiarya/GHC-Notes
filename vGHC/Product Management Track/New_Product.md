# Your New Product: What to Build and When to Build It

Ciara McDaniel, Senior Product Manager, Workday

So you're launching a new software product - what do you build first? And after that? Our world is changing every day - how do you handle these changes? At this talk you'll learn what to build and what not to build at each stage of your product launch. You'll also get valuable insights on topics like choosing your early adopters, go-live must-haves and realistic implementation timelines.

### Notes
* 3 phases of your new product
  * Before your first sale
    * Day 1 product evolution
    * What problem are we solving?
    * Why users will come back? spend time / money?
  * Build your first go-live
  * Before general availability - product live with few adopters, trying to scale
* 3 roadmap themes
  * Sale features - differentiate, make users pay to use your product
  * Basic features - wonâ€™t sell the product, nothing exciting, necessary for everyday use
  * Internal features - internal support like monitoring tools
* Geared towards B2B
