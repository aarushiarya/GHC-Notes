### Notes

* FMRI to check which parts of brain are getting fired
* Aim is to check how would brain respond if it knew math was coming; some normal problems and some math problems given to people who get stressed by math
* Seen that ancient part of brain gets fired up when they see math problem / get stressed; similar to response when you get threaten or near pain response
* Then brain was not able to do the task
* Tips
    * Change your mindset
        * Think beside emotional terms; what you can change; how you can do better; positive mindset
    * Practice under pressure; get used to it;
    * Communicate well; give the headline; to help them understand 
        * If we can communicate with the team then we can all do better
