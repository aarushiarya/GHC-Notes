Anne Lampman, Graduate Engineer, Arm Holdings; Susan Graham, Principal Engineer, Arm Holdings

### Notes

* Building your career
	* navigating currents of river
	* sometimes you can see where you are going and sometimes you don’t
	* sometimes you tip over / fall; get back up
* When you look at career, you look at
	* productivity - 
	* satisfaction 
* Learn to navigate
	* rethink what feedback is all about
	* think of feedback as relationship building
		* trust, mutual respect, mindfulness
		* open and vulnerable communications
		* emotional intelligence
		* bravery
		* deliberately with remote working
* Think of feedback as data
	* data needs multiple sources
	* data integrity needs to be preserved
	* data needs to have high degree of quality and usefulness
	* data sources need to be queried regularly
* Data needs to have multiple sources
	* need different perspectives
	* every individual needs to view you and the work you do differently
	* manager, tech lead, mentors, coach, coworkers in your group, coworkers in other groups, peers
* Data needs to be preserved
	* real, honest and free of biased
	* women more likely to receive subjective feedback
	* women receive more negative feedback about communication
	* in-group bias - favoring and protecting you
* Data needs to be high quality
	* specific and actionable
	* women get vague praise
	* women less likely to get developmental feedback, specific skills they should target to excel or improve
	* male managers more likely to have “protective hesitation” to female employees and not give critical feedback
* Query data sources regularly
	* avoid recency bias - reviewers tend to focus on most recent time period instead of total time period
	* ask feedback after a delivery
	* be brave and ask for feedback when you fail
* Call to action
	* feedback cycle - prepare and plan
	* prepare - identify customers, identify priorities and passions, self evaluate
	* feedback - collect data - manage relationship
	* plan + go - analyze data, revise, schedule
* Identify customers
	* think of yourself as a business
	* your value is your customer’s perceived value of your product 
	* what does your customer value?: on time completion, 100% completion, detailed summary vs concise summary
	* who uses your services? Who requires output or time from you?
		* manager, co-worker, project lead, mentee, direct reports, collaborators
* Prepare: identify priorities
		* introspection
			* what do you want?
			* what are your goals?
		* prioritize 
			* raise / promotion
			* working on high value / high visibility project
			* health / personal life
		* passions
			* sustainability project
			* new tool development
		* priority list - balance time/ effort
	* self evaluate
		* skill matrix:
		* inventory of skills - technical / interpersonal / project management / tools / problem solving / communication / delivery
		* skills that are needed for successful people in your organization
		* Assess your performance on skills
		* skill - simulation tool / scripting / leadership / time management / quality delivery / presentation skills
		* objectives matrix:
		* objective - align to business goals
			* why is it important
			* what is value
		* output - must have tangible output - used to measure success / completion
		* customer - must understand customers and stakeholders
		* priority - agree between yourself and stakeholders
		* completion date
* Collect data
* Get feedback on skill matrix and ask for evaluation
	* today in our conversation I am looking to get feedback on what you think objective A priorities over objective B
	* schedule 1 on 1
	* get lunch together
* Share objectives - ask for priorities and set expectations
* Inquire on specific work or skill
* Own your mistakes, ask for perspective
	* follow up on track improvement
* Pay attention to non verbal cues
  * level of enaggaement, eye contact, discomfort
* Record all feedback
	* 1on1 summary, email, other technology
* Analyze data
* Organize feedback as data
* Sanity check/understanding - does it add up? Clear message?
* Thinking - is something wrong?
* Review - with who? Clarification?
	* you gave me some critical feedback, I want to understand moving forward what behavior you need to see differently from me
* What bias may be present?
* Check with yourself - emotional response? How do you feel?
* Plan - Revise skill matrix
* Revise objectives - talk to all customers and stakeholders - summarize and agreement with stakeholder’s requirement
	* gather data through conversations
* Plan+Go
* Managing feedback cycle
* You are the driver !
* Plan out future points of collecting feedback
	* if you don’t put into a schedule, you will forget
	* work calendar with reminder
* How often may depend on task/objectives
	* frequency is based on completion
* Aspire to make it a habit vs a schedule
* Instinctive action
	* non-verbal queues, 
	* your mistakes - reengage, can you give me assessment on how I can do better
	* your successess - could you put it in writing and send it to me. Maybe CC my manager
