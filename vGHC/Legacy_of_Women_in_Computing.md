Women have played an integral role throughout the history of computing. From Ada Lovelace’s contributions to the Analytical Machine, to being among the earliest programmers, developing scientific computations, and sending man to safely orbit space, women have been essential to the innovation and evolution of computing and computer science. While being central to the advancement of computing it seems as if history has neglected to recognize their achievements. In this session, Vidya Srinivasan and Sheila Tejada, General Chairs of GHC 20, will discuss the legacy of these trailblazing women such as Fran Allen, Katherine Johnson, Grace Hopper, Mary Jackson, Anita Borg and Dorothy Vaughan, who have made a lasting impact on computing. Join them for a thoughtful discussion on how these women have put a dent in the glass ceiling to pave the way for all of us.

### Notes
* Earliest operating system
* Quantum computing 
* Much easier to apologize sometimes than ask for permission
* Most damaging phase is - “its always been done this way”; wrong attitude; if its always done this way doesnt mean it is the right way to do it
* First women to get Turing award - Fran Allen
* First black women to work for NASA - Katherine Johnson 
    * Movie - Hidden figures
* First women robot soccer champion in the world - sheila tejada
* Chief technology officer of White House - Megan Smith

Think about - 
* How do you want to give back
* Who is your favorite engineer in the field; how does their journey resonate with you
* What you want your legacy to be; who are you going to inspire
