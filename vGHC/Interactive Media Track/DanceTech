Swetha Prabakaran, Student / Dancer & Choreographer, University of California, Berkeley;

This talk examines and analyzes historical and emerging tech trends in the performing arts, with an emphasis on dance applications (“dancetech”). 

### Notes

* Computer science in dance
* Dance and choreography evolved with video cameras
* Artists film their work from different angles using camera - 2d - low quality
* High quality video camera - create choreography for recorded audience vs live audience
    * Zoom in and out
    * Big transitions, small eye moments
* Dancers adapt artistry to age advantage of new tech
    * Like tik-tok, need to stay stationary to captures movements
* Tech integration on stage
    * Lightening, sound, stage equipment
    * Performers interact with tech 
        * E-motion
        * Create holograms and video content
            * Done by beyonce
* Companies taking advantage in live shows - like MOMIX and Kafig
* Tech integration on dancer
    * LEDs in costumes
        * Pre program LEDs
        * Like elluminate
    - Paint movement of dancer’s feet on app
* Tech needs to adapt with dancers
    * Problems
    * Sturdier - tech needs to be ready to move in every and any movement; flexible and moveable
    * stealthier - tech is not visible; easily fits into the constume or dance performance
    * simpler - artists tour around the world, new stage, new country, tech is done by technicians on the stage
* Emerging innovations
    * Flexible e-tech material, printed pieces of tech to make costumes
* Lot of opportunities to develop tech for dancers
