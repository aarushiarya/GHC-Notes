COVID-19's impact has emphasized technology's important role in helping us adapt to all situations and people. With accessibility being a driving force for innovation in UX, we will explore how to teach empathy and inclusive thinking in students, by rethinking the games of UNO and Twister. We'll also discuss ways to conduct this workshop virtually and with a wider audience in this 'new normal'.

* Creating an environment of inclusion 
* Students - donâ€™t have personal computers / laptops
* not able to participate in class / studies
* Importance of accessibility - access products and services, participate in activities
* Barriers to accessibility except disability - language, location access, situational
* situational - due to covid
* classrooms gave equal playing field to everyone
* no personal laptops
* exposed inequality in student access to digital tools
* Accessibility activity
* come up with affordances to make popular games of UNO and twister accessible to all users
* consider - how can a user with low vision see color or number on UNO card
* include diversity - race, gender, language, cognitive / development
* user cards - which description of unique persona - disability user experiences
* read your user cards to the group - to make activity collaborative
* focus on one user at a time
* what aspects of game could be difficult for unique user; i.e. someone with low vision
* repeat for all users 
* what skills were demonstrated? Communication, enthusiasm and empathy, teamwork, networking, problem solving, professionals
* these 6 soft skills are most important when students transition from school to workplace
* remote - virtual persona cards, jam boards, virtual meetup
* Making connections to user experience
  * accessibility thinking  - provide equal chance for all users to access and use your design
  * think about accessibility in everything you design - who is using product, how they will use it
  * although something is accessible today, it might not be tomorrow
* Benefits to teach accessibility and inclusive design early
